# Privacy notice

## What the bot stores
We only store the server id where the bot operates in and the channel id the user sets.
The user may also optionally provide a role id 
to use for alerting which will be saved permanently.

The application keeps temporary logs which log the user id of users interacting
with the bot for security reasons (ex. misuse/spam/dos).

## What is done to the data.
The application does not share any data.

## I don't like this
If you want, you can self host the bot on your own platform.

The code of the bot is licensed under the MIT license and can be used according to the licence.

Note that I won't provide any tecnical support to forked or self hosted solutions.
